	<p>Time complexity measures how the running time of an algorithm changes as the input size increases. An algorithm is considered efficient if it has a low time complexity, meaning it can handle larger inputs quickly without a significant increase in execution time. For example, an algorithm with time complexity O(log n) is more efficient than one with O(nÂ²) because its running time grows much slower as input size increases. Understanding time complexity helps developers choose or design algorithms that perform well even with large datasets.</p>
	<p>Space complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of its input. When we say an algorithm has a space complexity of O(n), it means the memory required grows linearly with the input size. For example, if the input doubles, the space needed also roughly doubles. This often happens when an algorithm stores data structures like arrays or lists that hold all input elements or results proportional to the input size. Understanding <b>space complexity</b> helps ensure that an algorithm can run within the memory limits of a system.</p>
