	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a crucial factor in analyzing algorithms to ensure they are efficient in processing large amounts of data.</p>
	<p><strong>Space Complexity</strong> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses, often expressed as O(n) to represent its growth relative to input size.</p>
