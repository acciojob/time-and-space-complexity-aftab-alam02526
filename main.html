	<p>Time complexity is a way to measure how the running time of an algorithm changes relative to the size of its input. It provides a mathematical estimate of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete, usually expressed using Big O notation (like O(n), O(log n), etc.).</p>
	<p>Space complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of its input. When we say an algorithm has a space complexity of O(n), it means the memory required grows linearly with the input size. For example, if the input doubles, the space needed also roughly doubles. This often happens when an algorithm stores data structures like arrays or lists that hold all input elements or results proportional to the input size. Understanding <b>space complexity</b> helps ensure that an algorithm can run within the memory limits of a system.</p>
